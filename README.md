# AI-Powered Live Stream Automatic Pan / Zoom 

This project uses AI to dynamically apply digital pan and zoom effects to a fixed-perspective video of any land field sport (basketball, soccer, football, hockey). 

It automatically keeps the players in frame so you can focus on watching the game! This eliminates the need to have a someone manually operating the camera during a game, ideal for low budget productions like little league, rec-league, and high school sports. It leverages the YOLO model for human detection and OpenCV for video processing.

Created as an MVP that mimics the AutoStream feature in GameChanger's live stream app.

## Project Setup

### 1. **Clone the repository:**
```shell
git clone https://github.com/henrym105/autostream-dupe.git
cd autostream-dupe
```

### 2. **Install the required dependencies:**

- *project built with python 3.11.0*

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **(OPTIONAL) Download any video clip from Youtube!**
```shell
python youtube_download.py
```
- A small sample video `example_video.mp4` and `example_video_2.mp4` is included in the data/raw/  path of this repo for your convenience and will be used by default.
- in `youtube_download.py`, change the params in main function for url, desired_resolution, start and stop time (to create a short clip)


### 4. **Run the application:**
```shell
python main.py
```
- NOTE: will automatically save a local copy of the `Yolov11 nano` model weights from Ultralytics, but you can change the model being used in `constants.py`

## TODO

- [ ] Stabilize the zoom area -- still quite shaky
- [ ] Implement real-time streaming and processing.
- [ ] Enhance the user interface for easier configuration.
- [ ] Optimize the video processing pipeline for performance.
- [ ] Deploy to mobile and check performance.
- [ ] Add more documentation and examples.
